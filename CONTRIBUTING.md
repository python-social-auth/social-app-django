# How to contribute

I like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.

This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things
to consider when contributing. The following guidelines for
contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request.

## How to prepare

- You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues)
  for your issue if there is no one yet.
  - Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug.
  - Ensure to mention the earliest version that you know is affected.
- If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

## Make Changes

- In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming
  patch. (e.g. `feature/new-backend` or `bug/auth-fails`)
  - Usually this is based on the `master` branch.
  - Create a branch based on master `git branch bug/auth-fails master`
    then checkout the new branch with `git checkout bug/auth-fails`.
    Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
- Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.
- Make sure you stick to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  coding style that is used already.
- If possible, submit tests to your patch / new feature so it can be tested easily.
- Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests.
- Add a meaningful entry to the `CHANGELOG.md` document.

## Submit Changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right
  original branch you want to patch.
- If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please
  reference and update your issue with the code changes. But _please
  do not close the issue yourself_.
- Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly
  push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your
  pull request and approve.
